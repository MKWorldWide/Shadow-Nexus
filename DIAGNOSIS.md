# Shadow Nexus Repository Diagnosis

## Tech Stack Analysis

### Core Technologies
- **Node.js**: Primary runtime (version not pinned in package.json)
- **Database**: SQLite with Sequelize ORM
- **Discord**: Discord.js v14 for bot functionality
- **Testing**: Jest test framework
- **Linting/Formatting**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Package Manager**: npm (package-lock.json present)

### Key Dependencies
- @discordjs/rest
- discord-api-types
- discord.js
- sqlite3
- sequelize
- winston (logging)
- axios (HTTP client)
- joi (validation)
- jsonwebtoken (authentication)

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- Well-structured project organization
- Clear separation of concerns in source code
- Basic CI/CD setup with GitHub Actions
- Linting and formatting configured
- Environment variable management with dotenv

### Issues Found

#### 1. CI/CD Pipeline
- No GitHub Actions workflow files found in `.github/workflows/`
- Missing automated testing in CI
- No automated dependency updates
- No code coverage reporting

#### 2. Documentation
- README.md exists but could be more comprehensive
- No CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
- Missing API documentation
- No automated documentation generation

#### 3. Development Environment
- No Node.js version specified in `.nvmrc`
- Missing `engines` field in package.json
- No pre-commit hooks for code quality

#### 4. Security
- No security scanning in CI
- No dependency vulnerability scanning
- No rate limiting or input validation in API endpoints

## Proposed Improvements

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Set up GitHub Actions workflows for:
   - CI (lint, test, build)
   - Security scanning
   - Dependency updates
   - Automated releases

2. Update documentation:
   - Enhance README.md with badges and setup instructions
   - Add CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Add SECURITY.md
   - Add CHANGELOG.md

### Phase 2: Code Quality
1. Add test coverage reporting
2. Set up pre-commit hooks
3. Add TypeScript support
4. Improve error handling and logging

### Phase 3: Security
1. Add security scanning
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Add input validation
4. Set up dependency vulnerability scanning

## Implementation Plan

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflows
   - [ ] Update README.md
   - [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md
   - [ ] Add SECURITY.md
   - [ ] Add CHANGELOG.md

2. **Short-term Goals**
   - [ ] Set up test coverage reporting
   - [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
   - [ ] Add security scanning

3. **Long-term Goals**
   - [ ] Migrate to TypeScript
   - [ ] Add API documentation
   - [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts

## Notes
- This diagnosis is based on the repository state as of 2025-08-29
- Some improvements may require breaking changes
- Security-related changes should be prioritized
